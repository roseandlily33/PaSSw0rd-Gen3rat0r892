# Password Generator

## Description
The project this week was to make a password generator, it included premade HTML, and CSS, and then you had to do the JavaScript. The goal was to have prompts on the screen and depending on the yes and no's selected to generate a password between 8-128 characters, and must contain at least one of the following: uppercase, lowercase, special characters or numbers.

## Difficulties to note:
For some reason whenever I'm forking a repo on GitHub, for the projects my CSS ends up not working. So I've had to copy paste, push a pull, go around in a circle trying to get this to work. I had to move the CSS out of the Develop which I think may be causing the issues to get it to take.

## Acknowledgements
I used a lot of youtube tutorials on building projects to be able to do this project including a lot of searching on google for things such as:
How to return a value from a prompt
How to take an array and push it to another array
How to iterate over arrays

## Usage
Click the button and select the answers based on what you want your password to be

## Motivation
I think this is a great tool because a lot of websites are making you change your password because you've used it on another website, so this can be an easy way to come up with one that has password characteristics that isn't an easy password to guess.

## What I Learned:
I learned a lot in this project, this is the first JavaScript project that I have ever built, it was very intimidating at first, but overall through tons of trial and error I'm very pleased with how it came out. I learned how to return a prompt, that to send someone back the function needs to be called again, how to push arrays together, how to iterate over an array.
